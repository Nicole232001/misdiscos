    <p>I don't think I've ever come back to an album as much as I did with V. Most record albums have just one song that I like, and a bunch of just filler songs (which is how I felt with Drake's new album). With V, every song is awesome. There are days where I'll just put the album on shuffle and enjoy the music.

Maroon 5 uses synth rock with a very modern style to it. If you have been living under a rock for the past few decades and want to listen to something modern that's not garbage, you can't go wrong with Maroon 5. They've been around since the turn of the millennium, and they've managed to keep up with trends and styles very well. A few of their albums are hit and miss, but the best ones in my opinion are Songs About Jane and V. I listen to it digitally for free with my Google Music subscription, but I loved this album so much I bought the physical version.

V Deluxe comes with three new songs not included on the original album, including a cover of Marcy Playground's Sex and Candy, and Lost Stars, which was featured in the film Begin Again. The explicit version features all of the songs as they were originally recorded without any cuts or adaptions for radio listening. </p>
